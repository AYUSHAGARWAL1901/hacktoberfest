<h1>Instructions to Contribute</h1>
The Open source Community is awesome, to be a part of it you can start contributing and help people with their projects, here's a guide to do exactly that!
before you start here is something you should know:
<br>
1. <a href = "https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/">Hacktoberfest guide</a> <br>
2. <a href = "https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>

<h3> How to Contribute </h3>
<p>
 Step 1: Fork this repository. <br>
 Step 2: Go to your GitHub profile and you will find a repository with the same name as the project. Clone this repository either using the "Download zip" button under the code section or using git commands,
         you can use the command:
  
    git clone `link of the project (your fork)`
  
  to clone your forked repository into your local machine.

  now change your dirctory to the project using the command:
  
    cd NAME_OF_REPOSITORY
  
 Now check if your fork is set to remote origin. A remote is basically a URL that points to the project repository and the one you forked. The project repository is called the 'Upstream' remote and your fork is called the 'origin' remote. You can check the status of remotes using the command: 
  
    git remote -v 
  
  you should see the word origin next to your fork, if you don't see it, you can use the command to add it: 
  
    git remote add origin URL_OF_FORK
  
  now add the project repository as 'Upstream' remote using the command:
  
    git remote add upstream URL_OF_PROJECT
  
  now again use the command:
  
    git remote -v
  
  to check the status of remotes.
  
  
  Now to update your repository with the main project, you need to use the command:
  
    git pull upstream master
  
  or
  
    git pull upstream main
  
  depending upon the branch of the main project.
  
  Now, you should create a new branch as working in the main branch could be risky incase of an error or bugs, to add a new branch you can use the command:
  
    git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
  
  This also switches you to the new branch.
  
  And now you can make whatever changes you feel like to the code using various tools.
  After you are done making the required changes, you can stage those changes using the command: 
    
    git add -A
  
  and commit them using:
  
    git commit -m "A good description to the changes you made to the code."
  
  To push these changes you can use the command:
  
    git push origin BRANCH_NAME
  
  Going back to GitHub you may see a highlighted area which says "Compare and Pull Request", click that.
  This will send a pull request.
 
 Guidelines For contributors-:
 Register anytime between September 26 and October 31

Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)

Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total

Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest

The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
 
 MEASURES TO REDUCE SPAM
SPAMMY PULL/MERGE REQUESTS WILL BE LABELED AS “SPAM.”
Maintainers: label spammy requests “spam” and close them. PR/MRs labeled “spam” won’t count toward Hacktoberfest. Contributors with 2+ spammy PR/MRs are disqualified.

PULL/MERGE REQUESTS MUST BE APPROVED BY A MAINTAINER.
Maintainers accept PR/MRs by merging them, labeling them “hacktoberfest-accepted,” or giving them an overall approving review. Accepted PR/MRs enter a 7-day review window, during which approval can be revoked by the maintainer or by our team.

BAD REPOSITORIES WILL BE EXCLUDED.
PR/MRs should be useful to maintainers. Repos that encourage simplistic PR/MRs (like adding a name or profile to a list or arbitrarily curating content) will be excluded from Hacktoberfest. Remember: quantity is fun, quality is key.

Found a repository that you think doesn’t follow our values? REPORT IT TO US AND WE’LL TAKE A LOOK.

AVOID SUBMITTING LOW-QUALITY PULL/MERGE REQUESTS.
Hacktoberfest is about contributing meaningfully to open-source projects. Here are some examples of low-quality pull/merge requests that won’t count towards Hacktoberfest.

Automated pull/merge requests: scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace, fix typos or optimize images.
Disruptive pull/merge requests: taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a pull request.
Anything that a project maintainer flags as spam.
Anything that looks like an attempt to duplicate your pull request count for October.
Multiple pull/merge requests for the same issue that are unnecessary -for example five PR/MRs to remove a stray whitespace is not.
